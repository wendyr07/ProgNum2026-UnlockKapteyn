At 03:17 AM this morning, the Institute’s central research AI — ***scAInce*** — initiated *Autoprotection Mode*.

All lab access is locked.  
Cluster login restricted.  
Observatory dome sealed.  
Emergency override disabled.
Everything is not working!!!

Now, scAInce has classified all biological entities in the computer rooms as: 

***Warning: Unverified Organic Processes!***

To prevent “human error contamination”, it has taken full control of the rooms. 

You are now trapped here for an hour. The scAInce will only release control if you can finish two missions below:

1. Prove you are human
2. Hack into the system to turn off *Autoprotection Mode*.

You have **one hour** to do whatever your can in these missions.
